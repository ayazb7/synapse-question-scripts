Edoxaban exposure increases with renal impairment, and dose reduction is required when kidney function is reduced. Baseline FBC and LFTs are also sensible, but renal tests are critical for dose choice and ongoing monitoring. Review renal function at least annually, or more often if impaired. This is consistent with NICE NG196 and BNF recommendations.","[""Serum amylase"", ""ESR"", ""Renal function (eGFR/creatinine)"", ""Thyroid function tests"", ""Serum magnesium""]",2,2025-09-16T09:56:57Z,2025-09-16T09:56:57Z

When should apixaban be started after stopping warfarin?,True,Change to apixaban once the warfarin level (INR) falls below 2.

This avoids overlap that could over-anticoagulate the patient and also prevents a gap in therapy. Different DOACs have different INR thresholds for switching (e.g., edoxaban ≤2.5, rivaroxaban ≤3.0). Check the INR before starting the DOAC. This follows BNF/NICE NG196 guidance.","[""When INR is <1.0"", ""Immediately, regardless of INR"", ""When INR is between 2.5 and 3.0"", ""Two weeks after stopping warfarin, regardless of INR"", ""When INR is <2.0""]",4,2025-09-16T09:56:57Z,2025-09-16T09:56:57Z
